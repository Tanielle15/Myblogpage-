The Arc de Triomphe, located in the center of the Place de l'Ã‰toile, is a majestic sight that was built to honor the military. Its intricate design and historical significance make it a popular tourist attraction. And of course, the Eiffel Tower, an iconic symbol of Paris, is a must-see for anyone visiting the city. Built in 1889, it was initially met with mixed reviews, but it has now become the most popular tourist attraction in all of France. Whether you're an art lover, a history buff, or simply someone who appreciates beauty, Paris is a city that will capture your heart and leave you with memories to cherish for a lifetime. </p>

        <p class="text-muted"> Canada is an awe-inspiring destination that never fails to impress visitors with its natural beauty and breathtaking landscapes. A trip to Canada offers a wealth of options, from the thundering Niagara Falls to the serene beaches of the Great Lakes. Among the provinces that make up this vast and diverse country, Ontario is a standout destination that has something to offer everyone. One of the most iconic attractions in Ontario is undoubtedly Niagara Falls, a natural wonder that is nothing short of mesmerizing. The sheer power of the cascading water and the vivid blue hue of the falls are a sight to behold. You can visit the park for free and admire the falls from a distance, or you can take a boat ride for a closer encounter. The boat tour costs $28.25 per adult and $17.75 per child aged 6-12, while children under 5 can ride for free with a paid adult.

        <p class="text-muted"> The Royal Square (Place Royale), situated in the Royal Quarter of Brussels, is a majestic neoclassical square that dates back to the late 18th century. The square's grandeur and beauty are evident in its impressive architecture and historical significance. 

            The most significant building located on the square is the Royal Palace (Palais Royal), which serves as the official residence of the Belgian royal family. Built-in 1783, the Palace's architecture is a testament to the exquisite craftsmanship of the time, featuring a harmonious blend of neoclassical and Louis XVI styles. 
            
            The Palace is surrounded by lush green gardens that offer a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of the city. The gardens are adorned with beautiful fountains, statues, and several picturesque walkways. Visitors can take a leisurely stroll through the gardens and marvel at the stunning views of the Palace and the surrounding buildings.
            
            In addition to the Palace, the Royal Square is home to several other notable buildings, including the Brussels City Museum, the Royal Museums of Fine Arts, and the Magritte Museum. The museums offer a fascinating insight into Belgian art and history, making the Royal Square a must-visit destination for tourists and history enthusiasts alike. </p>

            <p>I watched the musical "Hamilton" with my cousins and it is a musical that tells the story of one of America's founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton, in a unique, energetic, and engaging way. The musical features a combination of hip-hop, R&B, and traditional show tunes to create a soundtrack that is both catchy and informative. The choreography and staging of the show are also impressive, with the actors moving around the stage in a fluid and dynamic way that adds to the energy of the performance. The show covers a wide range of topics, including love, war, politics, and betrayal, and provides a unique perspective on American history. While the show is suitable for audiences of all ages, parents with young children may want to consider whether their children will be able to follow the plot and understand the historical references. Overall, "Hamilton" is a fantastic show that is entertaining, informative, and a must-see for anyone who loves theater and history.

<p>I had the pleasure of watching the movie Hidden Figures with my sister. The film tells the true story of the remarkable achievements of three African-American women - Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson - during the space race. Set in the 1960s, the movie highlights the adversity and discrimination that these women faced while working at NASA. Despite the systemic racism and sexism, these women remained steadfast in their commitment to their work and ultimately played a crucial role in sending astronaut John Glenn into orbit. The movie is truly an inspiring tale of perseverance, resilience, and triumph over adversity. It is a must-watch for anyone interested in history, science, or the fight for civil rights. That being said, due to some of the mature themes presented in the movie, it may not be suitable for young children.
